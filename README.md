# Java Class Imports Folding [OBSOLETE]

This extension is obsolete.

This extension was a workaround for [vscode-java#2133](https://github.com/redhat-developer/vscode-java/issues/2133), which is fixed in [Language Support for Java(TM) by Red Hat v1.12](https://github.com/redhat-developer/vscode-java/releases/tag/v1.12.0).
